Dataset:
We are using “MotionSense Dataset” here for our project.This dataset includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected with an iPhone 6s kept in the participant's front pocket using SensingKit which collects information from Core Motion framework on iOS devices. A total of 24 participants in a range of gender, age, weight, and height performed 6 activities in 15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking, jogging, sitting, and standing.There are 24 data subjects. The A_DeviceMotion_data folder contains time-series collected by both Accelerometer and Gyroscope for all 15 trials. For every trial we have a multivariate time-series. Thus, we have time-series with 12 features: attitude.roll, attitude.pitch, attitude.yaw, gravity.x, gravity.y, gravity.z, rotationRate.x, rotationRate.y, rotationRate.z, 
userAcceleration.x, userAcceleration.y, userAcceleration

(A) DeviceMotion_data

This folder contains time-series collected by both Accelerometer and Gyroscope for all 15 trials. 

Thus, we have time-series with 12 features:
1. attitude.roll
2. attitude.pitch
3. attitude.yaw
4. gravity.x
5. gravity.y
6. gravity.z
7. rotationRate.x
8. rotationRate.y
9. rotationRate.z
10. userAcceleration.x
11. userAcceleration.y
12. userAcceleration.z
    
The accelerometer measures the sum of two acceleration vectors: gravity and user acceleration. User acceleration is the acceleration that the user imparts to the device

(B) Accelerometer_data

Here we just have data reported by Accelerometer sensor. Thus, there are just three features correspond to 3 different axes:
1. x
2. y
3. z

(C) Gyroscope_data
Here we just have data reported by Gyroscope sensor. Thus, there are again just three features correspond to 3 different axes:
1. x
2. y
3. z

Labels 

There are 6 different labels:
